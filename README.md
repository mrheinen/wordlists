# Lophiid wordlists

This repo contains wordlists collected with the
[Lophiid](https://github.com/mrheinen/lophiid) honeypot.  They are collected
from bruteforce attempts against the honeypots.

Note however that these lists are not complete. The honeypots have ratelimiting
methods implemented and typically these bruteforce attempt exceed the rate
limits. As a result we typically do not collect all possible credential
combinations for each bruteforce attack.

Regardless, these lists are useful for those who want to perform a check against
there own servce.

# Stats

This list is compiled from 8.7 million bruteforce requests seen by honeypots
during 2024. There are 1.1 million unique credentials and in total we say 161
thousant unique usernames and 466 thousand unique passwords.
